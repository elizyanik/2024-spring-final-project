This project was from a data set originally given to me about a year ago but,
up until this course I did not know of a good way of analyze this to get to the given goal.
I really enjoyed working with this data set the past few weeks specifically as it really put
to the test the skills we had learned in class and taught me good practice on how to start another.
Very excited to be working with larger data sets this summer to keep practicing and maybe do something 
a bit more meaningful with said analysis. I did not acheive the main goal of churn analysis but was able
to find a theoretical next step to take to get there with both the current data and if more is able to be attained.

Have a good summer!
